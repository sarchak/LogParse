Run Compile.sh

This will compile all the source files and run the map reduce job
considering logparse.txt as the input source file and the
output is written in /user/shrikar/logparse/*.

This program is far from being efficient. I has fiddled around with cores
and segmentation faults.. Facing InvalidExceptions to this extent for the first time :(


If there is only one entry for the corresponding entry and he hasnt performed that
operation for the second time the entry would be displayed as -999999999 to signify
he has done operation only once.

In the code LogParse.java relates to the code where we identify set depending on the event, user
and the timestamp.

LogParseAll handles the scenario where the key the user and value is the timestamp.
In this case we dont consider about the event type .

Thanks,
